## Who am I?

I'm Dan, a first year Computer Science Student at the University of Southampton. I am also a Co-Founder of [Questioneer][Questioneer], a volunteer at [SourceBots][SourceBots], writer of crazy Hackathon projects and designer of weird computer networks. Additionally, in my free time, I write and contribute to Open Source software projects, help lead a group of Beaver Scouts and make CTF (Capture the Flag) exercises.

## That's a lot of stuff...

Yep, I also:

- Attend sessions and am secretary of [SUCSS][sucss] (Southampton University Cyber Security Society)
- I am a member of SUWS (Southampton University Wireless Society) and will be working towards getting my Amateur Radio Licence soon.
- I work on my [projects](/projects).
- Once in a blue moon, I write a [blog](/posts) post.
- Somehow find time to cook food and relax occasionally.
