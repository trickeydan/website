I've been involved in quite a few projects, here are some of the more interesting ones.

## SR2022 Kit Project

Major upgrade to the Student Robotics Kit for 2022. Consists of many components, including:

- [j5](https://github.com/j5api/j5) - New API Framework
    - User Experience First
    - New USB Drivers
    - Upgrade to Python 3, including a fully type-hinted codebase
- [sr-robot3](https://github.com/srobo/sr-robot3) - User-facing API, based on j5
- [Astoria](https://github.com/srobo/astoria) - Robot Management System
    - Detect and execute code on USB drives
    - Resolve "metadata" to allow fine-grained environment control
    - Web Interface to control and view execution
    - MQTT-based IPC, allowing for remote and local control

## RIOT

[RIOT](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT) is an operating system for the Internet of Things. I spent quite a bit of time at University using it, contributing to it and [writing about it](/docs/riot.pdf).

## Tacheo

An educational startup company I founded with my best friend. We raised over Â£30,000 of funding for the venture, including a [live pitch on stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZCrgUA-fpA).
