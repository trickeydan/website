It seems that yet again I have found myself wasting my time creating slightly insane projects at Hackathons and this one trumps the previous ones by a fair bit.

The inspiration for this came from the [recent scandals][fb-scandal] about Facebook sharing user data with the policital firm Cambridge Analytica. This was then combined with some slightly crazy
computer science students, our success from [Brumhack 7.0][brumhack] and [Kajetan's][kch] desire to learn how to create games.

It is perhaps not beneficial to my degree that [Hack The South][hts] is held so close to the exam period, but it seems that I was not the only student enticed by a promise of free food and the opportunity to
win things for creating slightly useless code.
