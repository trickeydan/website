Questioneer is a startup company that aims to develop a new revision experience for A Level and GCSE Maths Students. We are creating a unique tool to help pupils and teachers alike tackle the problem of new examination specifications.

We are currently looking for investment and will be presenting at [FutureWorlds][futureworlds]' Dragons' Den event on 12th May at the University of Southampton.
