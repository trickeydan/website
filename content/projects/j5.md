{{< project j5 >}}

j5 is a unified robotics library that aims to create a single API for controlling robots. It was originally designed to combine the codebases of Student Robotics, SourceBots and Robocon.

I am the original author and started the project out of frustration at the limited ability of the current APIs, abundance of Python 2 and duplication of work between volunteers.

You can visit and contribute to the project on [our GitHub](https://github.com/j5api/j5).
