{{< project sourcebots >}}

SourceBots is a volunteer organisation which runs exciting robotics challenges for teams of young people. Whilst based at the University of Southamptonâ€™s Department of Electronics and Computer Science and led by its students, SourceBots contributors include teachers and professional engineers.

I am currently the secretary of SRO (Southampton Robotics Outreach), the parent organisation and student society of SourceBots.
